        <h2>About me</h2>
        <h5>
          I'm a multimedia design student at KEA, specializing in frontend
          development.
        </h5>
        <p>
          I’m a calm and dedicated person. I solve challenges with a curious
          mind and always strive to do my best as well as optimize my
          assignments.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a background as an electrician and that has developed and sound
          logik and an eye for details that has been very useful to me since
          changing lane into to the world of developers. Today I really enjoy
          creating responsive solutions and working with the HTML, CSS, JS and
          I'm eager to learn to more whether it be JS frameworks, CMS or
          something third.
        </p>
        <p>
          In school during our first two semesters we have covered themes suchs
          as UI design and development, UX, content creation, and technology and
          business.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently on the third semester elective "Frontend development"
          and here we deepened our knowlegde of javascript & used it as a tool
          to solve visual challenges. Soon we will we will learn about forms,
          how to create them, validate the input and storing the data and in the
          end of our elective we will work with React for three weeks.
